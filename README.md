## General info
* The game contains three modes: Player vs. Player, Player vs. AI, and AI vs. AI.
* Each player has three ships
* You can choose three different AI modes: Cheating AI, Random AI, and Hunt-Destroy AI.
* The game is represented on a 6 x 6 board.

## Setup
* A configuration text file to setup the board
* Follow the prompts on the screen to choose your mode, place your ships, and fire at your opponent's board.

## Features
* Each player has three ships.
* The Cheating AI already knows the coordinates of your ship, so it will hit everytime.
* The Random AI fires randomly at the board.
* The Hunt-Destroy AI fires randomly until there is a hit. Then, it will hit around the coordinate it hit to sink the ship.

To-do list:
* Additional input validation
* Random ship placement feature needs improvement
